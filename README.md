# Html-Css-Bootstrap-MINI_PROJECTS
I did simple mini projects in HTML CSS and BOOTSTRAP, I created these projects while I learned web development.
This repository contains most simple projects in HTML, css, css flexbox, css grid, bootstrap. 
I have created folders and uploaded them, go through the folders you can find index.html files 
                                              (YOU CAN'T RUN THESE FILES DIRECTLY LIKE MENTIONED BELOW)

                                              1. IN INDEX.HTML FILE CLICK "RAW"
                                              2. GO TO THE URL BAR AND CHANGE THE raw.githubusercontent.com TO raw.githack.com
                                              BOOM YOU CAN SEE THE SITE LIVE :)
