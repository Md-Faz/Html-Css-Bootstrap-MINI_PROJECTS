# Html-Css-Bootstrap-MINI_PROJECTS
I did simple mini projects in HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT, I created these projects while I learned web development.
This repository contains most simple projects in HTML, css, css flexbox, css grid, bootstrap and javascript. 
I have created folders and uploaded them, go through the folders you can find index.html files 
                                              (YOU CAN'T RUN THESE FILES DIRECTLY INSTEAD DO THIS -->)

                                              1. IN INDEX.HTML FILE CLICK "RAW"
                                              2. GO TO THE URL BAR AND CHANGE THE raw.githubusercontent.com TO raw.githack.com
                                              BOOM YOU CAN SEE THE SITE LIVE :)
